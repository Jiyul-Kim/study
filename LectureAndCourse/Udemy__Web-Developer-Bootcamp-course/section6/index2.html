    <h1>HTML</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
      The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for
      documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It is often assisted
      by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets <a href="#">(CSS)</a> and scripting
      languages such as JavaScript.
    </p>
    <p>
      Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local
      storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes
      the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for
      its appearance.

    <p>
      In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and
      prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share
      documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based
      hypertext system.[3] Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and
      server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems
      engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but
      the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes of
      1990, Berners-Lee listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is
      used"; an encyclopedia is the first entry.[4]

      The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called
      "HTML Tags",[5] first mentioned on the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late
      1991.[6][7] It describes 18 elements comprising the initial, relatively
      simple design of HTML. Except for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly
      influenced by SGMLguid, an in-house Standard Generalized Markup Language
      (SGML)-based documentation format at CERN. Eleven of these elements still
      exist in HTML 4.[8]

    <h2>Semantic HTML</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
      Semantic HTML is a way of writing HTML that emphasizes the meaning of the
      encoded information over its presentation (look). HTML has included
      semantic markup from its inception,[84] but has also included
      presentational markup, such as tags. There are also the semantically
      neutral div and span tags. Since the late 1990s, when Cascading Style
      Sheets were beginning to work in most browsers, web authors have been
      encouraged to avoid the use of presentational HTML markup with a view to
      the separation of content and presentation.[85]
    </p>
    <p>
      In a 2001 discussion of the Semantic Web, Tim Berners-Lee and others gave
      examples of ways in which intelligent software "agents" may one day
      automatically crawl the web and find, filter, and correlate previously
      unrelated, published facts for the benefit of human users.[86] Such agents
      are not commonplace even now, but some of the ideas of Web 2.0, mashups
      and price comparison websites may be coming close. The main difference
      between these web application hybrids and Berners-Lee's semantic agents
      lies in the fact that the current aggregation and hybridization of
      information is usually designed by web developers, who already know the
      web locations and the API semantics of the specific data they wish to
      mash, compare and combine.
